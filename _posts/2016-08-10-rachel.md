  Rachel lives with her husband Richard and little girl Willow. After a bit of a
  traumatic start in NICU Willow is a feisty little redhead who is in to
  EVERYTHING! Rachel will tell you about her experience of neo-natal care and
  coming out the other side, making a rod for her own back and accepting herself
  as a 'stay at home mum'. Rachel feels it's perfectly acceptable to eat
  chocolate before 7:30 in the morning, pretend she makes more than she spends
  on craft projects and still rely on her mum to keep any flowers in her garden
  alive.
