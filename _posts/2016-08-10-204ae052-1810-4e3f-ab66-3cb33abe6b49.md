Meet Larissa, mother to a little boy called Oliver. Originally from England, Larissa lived in Australia for almost 10 years where she met her Irish husband Alastair. After returning to England in 2013 they soon found themselves relocating again at the end of 2015, this time to Ireland for Alastair's work. After 15 years working in Office Management and Facilities, Larissa recently left her last job to become a full time mummy (or mammy as they call it in Ireland). Larissa hopes to tell you tales of travelling with a baby, moving house, requesting flexible working at work after being on maternity leave and trying to warm up in a city where it rains a LOT! Larissa loves chocolate, wine, swimming, walking her dog (preferably without Oliver), sleeping (which she don't seem to do much of these days) and holidays!!
